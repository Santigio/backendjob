## Tech Stack

+ For this service, I would recommend using the following tech stack:
1. Node.js - This is a JavaScript runtime that allows for fast and efficient server-side development. It also has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that can be used for building the service.

2. Express.js - This is a popular web framework for Node.js that provides a simple and intuitive way to build HTTP APIs.

3. MongoDB - This is a NoSQL database that is well-suited for storing large amounts of data and handling high traffic loads. It is also flexible and easy to scale, making it a good choice for this service.

4. Mongoose - This is an Object Document Mapper (ODM) for MongoDB that makes it easy to map database objects to JavaScript objects and vice versa. It also provides a simple and intuitive API for interacting with the database.

5. Jest - This is a testing framework that is well-suited for testing Node.js applications. It is easy to use, has a large number of features, and is well-supported by the community.

6. OpenAPI 3.0 - This is a specification for building APIs that allows for easy documentation and testing of API endpoints. It can be used to define the API endpoints and request/response schemas for this service.

## HTTP APIs

+ List top users by internet usage

Endpoint: /api/users/top

Method: GET

Parameters:

  time_period (optional, one of "1d", "7d", "30d"): The time period for which to retrieve the top users. Defaults to "1d".
  page (optional, integer): The page number for the results. Defaults to 1.
  limit (optional, integer): The number of results per page. Defaults to 10.
  
Response:
  
  200: Success. Returns a list of users sorted by internet usage in descending order. Each user has the following fields:
  id (string): The unique identifier for the user.
  name (string): The name of the user.
  usage (integer): The total internet usage for the specified time period (in bytes).
  created_at (string): The date and time when the user was created (in ISO 8601 format).
  
+ Search users by name

Endpoint: /api/users/search

Method: GET

Parameters:

  name (required, string): The name of the user to search for.

Response:

  200: Success. Returns a list of users matching the specified name. Each user has the following fields:
  id (string): The unique identifier for the user.
  name (string): The name of the user.
  usage (integer): The total internet usage for the specified time period (in bytes).
  created_at (string): The date and time when the user was created (in ISO 8601 format).
  
## Database Model

  The database model for this service will consist of a single collection called "users", which will store the following fields for each user:
  id (string): The unique identifier for the user.
  name (string): The name of the user.
  usage (integer): The total internet usage for the specified time period (in bytes).
  created_at (string): The date and time when the user was created (in ISO 8601 format).
  This model will allow for fast and efficient retrieval of user data, as well as easy query. 



+++ To ingest the provided dataset into the service's database, we can create a script that reads the data from the file and inserts it into the "users" collection in the database.

--- Here is an example of how this script might work:

1. Connect to the database using Mongoose.
2. Read the data from the file and parse it into a JavaScript object.
3. Iterate through the object and create a new "User" model for each record.
4. Save the model to the database.


Here is a code to demonstrates how this script might work:

const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const User = require('./models/user');

// Connect to the database
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/internet_usage', { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });

// Read the data from the file and parse it into a JavaScript object
const data = require('./data.json');

// Iterate through the data and create a new User model for each record
data.forEach(record => {
  const user = new User({
    id: record.id,
    name: record.name,
    usage: record.usage,
    created_at: record.created_at
  });

  // Save the model to the database
  user.save();
});

// Close the database connection
mongoose.connection.close();


This script can be run from the command line using the following command:
  node ingestion_script.js



--- To implement the paginated HTTP API to list top users by their internet usage, we can create an endpoint that accepts the following parameters:

  time_period (optional, one of "1d", "7d", "30d"): The time period for which to retrieve the top users. Defaults to "1d".
  page (optional, integer): The page number for the results. Defaults to 1.
  limit (optional, integer): The number of results per page. Defaults to 10.
  The endpoint should return a list of users sorted by internet usage in descending order, with the specified number of results per page.

Here is an example of how this endpoint might work:

const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const User = require('../models/user');

// List top users by internet usage
router.get('/top', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Parse the query parameters
    const timePeriod = req.query.time_period || '1d';
    const page = parseInt(req.query.page) || 1;
    const limit = parseInt(req.query.limit) || 10;

    // Set the date range based on the time period
    let startDate, endDate;
    if (timePeriod === '1d') {
      startDate = new Date();
      startDate.setDate(startDate.getDate() - 1);
      endDate = new Date();
    } else if (timePeriod === '7d') {
      startDate = new Date();
      startDate.setDate(startDate.getDate() - 7);
      endDate = new Date();
    } else if (timePeriod === '30d') {
      startDate = new Date();
      startDate.setDate(startDate.getDate() - 30);
      endDate = new Date();
    }

    // Retrieve the top users from the database
    const users = await User.find({
      created_at: {
        $gte: startDate,
        $lte: endDate
      }
    })
      .sort({ usage: -1 })
      .skip((page - 1) * limit)
      .limit(limit);

    // Send the results back to the client
    res.send(users);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send(error);
  }
});

module.exports = router;


This endpoint can be accessed by sending a GET request to the following URL:
  /api/users/top?time_period=7d&page=2&limit=20

This will return the top 20 users for the past 7 days, starting from page 2.


--- To implement the user details HTTP API to search users by their exact name, we can create an endpoint that accepts a name parameter and returns the matching user's internet usage consumption.

Here is an example of how this endpoint might work:

const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const User = require('../models/user');

// Search users by name
router.get('/search', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Retrieve the user from the database
    const user = await User.findOne({ name: req.query.name });

    // Send the results back to the client
    res.send(user);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send(error);
  }
});

module.exports = router;
